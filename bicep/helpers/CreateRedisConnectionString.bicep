/*
I'm leaving this module here as an anti-pattern reference, it is not good practice as connection strings should not be written to outputs.

This module demonstrates an interesting pattern, where the behaviour of ListKeys is;
"ListKeys requires a value that can be calculated at the start of the deployment"
However we need to delay the evaluation of ListKeys until after the resource is created in a module.
